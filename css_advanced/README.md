📖 DESCRIPTION
This project is part of my learning journey in advanced CSS and modern web design. It demonstrates the use of semantic HTML5 structure, responsive layouts, CSS styling (Flexbox, Grid, variables, animations), and accessibility-friendly design practices.
The page is modeled as a mock "Smileschool" landing site, featuring navigation, hero section, testimonials, popular tutorials, membership information, and a FAQ section — all styled with advanced CSS concepts.
✨ FEATURES
Semantic HTML5 structure with <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.
Responsive navigation bar with logo and links.
Hero banner with call-to-action button.
Instructor showcase section with images and descriptions.
Testimonial blockquote styled with accompanying images.
Popular tutorials section including ratings with FontAwesome star icons.
Membership benefits section with reusable card layouts.
FAQ accordion-like structure for multiple questions/answers.
Footer with logo, copyright, and social media icons.
🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES USED
HTML5 (semantic structure)
CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, variables, transitions, animations)
Font Awesome (icons for stars & social media)
Responsive meta tags for mobile support

While building this project I practiced:
Using Flexbox for alignment and responsive layouts.
Organizing a webpage with semantic HTML5 elements.
Embedding Font Awesome icons for UI consistency.
Structuring reusable sections (cards for tutorials/membership).
Thinking about accessibility (alt text, readable structure).
📌 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Add responsive CSS breakpoints for tablets and small screens.
Include hover/transition effects for buttons and links.
Implement an FAQ accordion with JavaScript.
Replace placeholder images with real project assets.
